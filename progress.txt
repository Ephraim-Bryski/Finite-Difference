can do very basic simulations in multiple dimensions, but basically just limited to difusion and advection right now

constant field which can't be updated (e.g. for depth for the wave equation)

set initial conditions to piecewise function
    specify range of values to set it for as an optional argument

could make creating a field a method of Model (which should instead be called Model)
    this way the Model object would now have access to all the fields (stored in a tuple)
        allows for check that all of them have been time updated

create new class for a field at the current time --> allows for better error handling if there's a size mismatch
    then no computations allowed on fields, computations only allowed on these slices
    f.now returns an instance, as does f.derivative()

methods for initial conditions and boundary conditions which would call set_expression


allow to get data based on coordinate instead of index

check variables in expression for set_expression --> better error messages for invalid expression

good visualization of fields

more consistent/better naming
    values instead of data
