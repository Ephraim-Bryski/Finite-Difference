can do very basic simulations in multiple dimensions




User Messages

    overall better error messages --> specify names (e.g. of axes) whenever possible

    warning if unknowns are spreading (would have to compare second iteration vs first iteration)

    add assertion that all IC are set up properly before starting the run 

    check variables in expression for set_expression --> better error messages for invalid expression

Additional Stuff Now

    good visualization of fields

    give fields names so they can be referenced here in the error message
        important for creating interactive visuals <-- need names for fields

Refactor

    make properties that are lists that should be immutable tuples

    improved comments

    more consistent/better naming
        values instead of data?
        old instead of prev?
        fieldslice? be consistent at least


Additional Stuff Later



    set initial conditions to piecewise function
        specify range of values to set it for as an optional argument
        allow to get data based on coordinate instead of index




    runge-kutta

    solve BVP

    constant field which can't be updated (e.g. for depth for the wave equation)

    vector fields (and operations like grad div)
