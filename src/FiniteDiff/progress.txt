can do very basic simulations in multiple dimensions

Bugs



User Messages/Interface Improvements

    having time derivative fields for dropdown is a bit too much --> mabye filter out fields with "dot" in the name

    overall better error messages --> specify names (e.g. of axes) whenever possible






    warning if unknowns are spreading (would have to compare second iteration vs first iteration)

    add assertion that all IC are set up properly before starting the run 





Additional Stuff Later

    actually good visualization of fields

    when setting expressions, you can't include variable values cause it's just strings
        not sure how to fix this one D:

    set initial conditions to piecewise function
        specify range of values to set it for as an optional argument
        allow to get data based on coordinate instead of index

    runge-kutta

    solve BVP

    constant field which can't be updated (e.g. for depth for the wave equation)

    vector fields (and operations like grad div)
