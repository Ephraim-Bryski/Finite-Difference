can do very basic simulations in multiple dimensions

Bugs
    plot cant plot edge (not the widget one just the static one)

Additional Stuff Later

    mapping fields between edges and cells

    warning if unknowns are spreading (would have to compare second iteration vs first iteration)

    actually good visualization of fields


    set initial conditions to piecewise function
        specify range of values to set it for as an optional argument
        allow to get data based on coordinate instead of index

    runge-kutta and implicit time schemes

    some way of handling stencils with coordinates that aren't just immediate neighbors
        have an asymmetric stencil at the boundaries
        make the boundary condition have some thickness, so data isn't lost

    solve BVP

    vector fields (and operations like grad div)
