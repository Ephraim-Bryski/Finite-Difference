can do very basic simulations in multiple dimensions

Bugs

    imshow plots are not getting cleared when using ipywidgets
    when no fields, get an error about field_names index out of range --> catch sooner
    Stencil([1,-2,1],2) gives singular matrix error --> need to catch earlier (i think cause of duplicate values)
    catch error if only one number in axis array when constructing model
    when time values are infinite repeating decimals (e.g. 1/3 or 0.333 etc.) gets an error that it can't get the index for the slider
        just get the closest value instead

User Messages/Interface Improvements

    having time derivative fields for dropdown is a bit too much --> mabye filter out fields with "dot" in the name



    overall better error messages --> specify names (e.g. of axes) whenever possible

    warning if unknowns are spreading (would have to compare second iteration vs first iteration)

    add assertion that all IC are set up properly before starting the run 

    check variables in expression for set_expression --> better error messages for invalid expression

    if prev used instead of new, maybe suggest that time wasn't incremented?


Additional Stuff Now

    good visualization of fields

    give fields names so they can be referenced here in the error message
        important for creating interactive visuals <-- need names for fields

Refactor

    make properties that are lists that should be immutable tuples

    improved comments

    more consistent/better naming
        values instead of data?
        old instead of prev?
        fieldslice? be consistent at least


Additional Stuff Later

    when setting expressions, you can't include variable values cause it's just strings
        not sure how to fix this one D:

    set initial conditions to piecewise function
        specify range of values to set it for as an optional argument
        allow to get data based on coordinate instead of index




    runge-kutta

    solve BVP

    constant field which can't be updated (e.g. for depth for the wave equation)

    vector fields (and operations like grad div)
